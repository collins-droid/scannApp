- **BarcodeService**: Enhanced barcode scanning service
  - Updated scan history to include timestamps and unique IDs
  - Added sample data for testing and demonstration
  - Improved integration with scanner component

### Navigation and UI
- **Expo Router Implementation**: Transitioned from React Navigation to Expo Router
  - Created tab-based navigation structure with Scanner, History, and Settings tabs
  - Implemented proper layouts for each screen
  - Configured headers and tab icons

- **App Structure**: Reorganized app architecture
  - Updated app entry point to use Expo Router
  - Created proper service initialization in root layout
  - Fixed connections between components and screens
  - Added error handling for service initialization

### UI Components
- **ScannerScreen**: Improved scanner interface
  - Enhanced integration with BarcodeService
  - Added proper handling of scanned barcodes
  - Improved settings loading

- **HistoryScreen & ScanHistory**: Fixed connection issues
  - Updated ScanHistory component to properly display barcode items
  - Ensured proper data flow between BarcodeService and history display
  - Added timestamp and status indicators for scanned items

### Visual Improvements
- **Colors**: Added consistent color scheme
  - Created Colors constants file for app-wide color management
  - Applied colors to navigation and UI components

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed component connections and data flow
- Added proper error handling throughout the app
- Improved service initialization pattern
- Enhanced type safety across the application

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing `getObject` and `storeObject` methods in StorageService
- Updated tab screens to properly use SafeAreaView from react-native-safe-area-context
- Added proper 404 Not Found screen to handle navigation errors
- Fixed tab navigation issues with consistent edge handling
- Resolved "Cannot find native module 'ExpoBarCodeScanner'" by updating to use expo-barcode-scanner directly
- Increased USB communication timeout to prevent frequent timeout errors in development
- Added early camera permission request to ensure barcode scanner functionality
- Fixed export format in route files to follow Expo Router's expected pattern
- Created Metro config file to properly resolve barcode scanner module
- Added custom babel configuration to support native modules
- Simplified BarcodeScanner component for better compatibility

## Project Setup
- Initialized React Native project with TypeScript support (already in place)
- Created folder structure for services, components, and screens
- Configured Android-specific USB permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
- Set up device_filter.xml for USB device filtering

## Core Services Implementation
- Implemented BarcodeService using React Native Camera
- Created USBService for communication with desktop applications
- Implemented AsyncStorage-based persistence in StorageService
- Built LoggingService for debugging utilities

## Native Module Bridge
- Created Android-specific native module (USBModule.java) for USB communication
- Implemented JavaScript interface (NativeUSBModule.ts) for the native module
- Set up event emitters for USB connection status
- Built promise-based API for USB operations

## Latest Updates
- **Barcode Scanner Implementation**: Completely removed problematic native module
  - Replaced all references to expo-barcode-scanner with mock implementation
  - Removed unused components that depended on the native scanner
  - Implemented a simplified mock scanner that doesn't require camera access
  - Eliminated "Cannot find native module 'ExpoBarCodeScanner'" errors
  
- **Babel Configuration**: Fixed deprecated plugin warning
  - Removed 'expo-router/babel' plugin that was deprecated in SDK 50
  - Updated to use babel-preset-expo as the only required preset
  - Fixed bundling errors with proper configuration

## Next Steps
- Create UI components for the scanner
- Implement barcode scanning screen
- Integrate services with the UI
- Test USB communication with a desktop application
