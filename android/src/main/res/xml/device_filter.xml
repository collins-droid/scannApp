        USB device filters. 
        You can add specific vendor and product IDs to filter for specific devices.
        These are example values and should be replaced with actual device IDs.
        
        Example:
        <usb-device vendor-id="1234" product-id="5678" />
    -->
    
    <!-- This is a generic filter that will match most USB devices -->
    <usb-device />
    
    <!-- Add specific device filters as needed -->
    <!-- <usb-device vendor-id="0x0000" product-id="0x0000" /> -->
